//JavaScript Variables & Declarations.

* ES5 :- ECMAScript, a foundational version of JavaScript released in 2009, initially named livescript.
* var :- ES5 (old)
* let, const :- ES6 (new)
* Keyword :- Any word that has some meaning.
* variables declared and initialised using "var" keyword can be changed anytime again and again. But it's not ethical.
* So we use "let" keyword. Here, Variables once declared can't be declared again.
* We use "const" keyword when we know the definite final value of a variable. Can't be changed again either.
